# README
I am an operations manager at an accounting firm in Miami. I'm currently working on a BS in data analytics. I am new to tech and am amazed at everything i have learned so far. I'm not going to lie, its been challenging but very rewarding to see how quickly i've been able to understand python and how programing works. I know i have a long, challenging road ahead of me but i'm excited for whats to come. This course has helped me access resources i did not know were available and it has helped me meet others in the indusrty. I am very happy i took this course and i think it should continue the way it is, as it has been very helpful for someone like me, who is an absolute beginner. Some of my favorite hobbies include, cooking, traveling and yoga.
